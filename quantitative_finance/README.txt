Quantitative trading of financial securities is a multi-billion dollar business employing thousands of portfolio 
managers and quantitative analysts (quants) trained in maths, physics, or other hard sciences

These quants trade stocks and other securities creating liquidity for investors and competing to the best of their
ability to find and exploit any mispricings with their systematic data-driven trading algorithms.

The result is highly efficient financial markets which are still not immune to crowding, bubbling, ocassional
liquidation panic, and "cobra effects" which include the high-frequency trading (HFT) arms race

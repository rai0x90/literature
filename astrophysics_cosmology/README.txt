║  Astrophysics/Cosmology ║
╚═════════════════════════╝

The study of the physics of the universe, the underlying mechanics of everything around us including the Earth from the perspective of a celestial body.
Astrophysics is technically a branch within astronomy. The resources will also cover a variety of literature/media pertaining to cosmology, my personal
favorite area within astronomy to study which deals with the study of the universe on the largest scale. Cosmology is again technically a sub-field within
astrophysics.
